Q: Your task is to give the example(s) of such a real-life situation where we use Data Analytics and link it with the data analytics process. 
You can prepare a PPT/PDF on a real-life scenario explaining it with the above process (Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) and submit it as part of this task.

PREPARING FOR EXAM
Plan: Making a to-do list as to which chapters need to be done first. Schedule a time-table to give
time to all chapters. Planning to do sample papers afterwards
Prepare: We need to see if we already have the study material for the subject or do we need to fetch
it from somewhere. Referring to YouTube videos and online websites for study materials, that is
basically, your dataset for the task.
Process: We need to see from the fetched data and skip the topics that are not mentioned in the
syllabus (which is also a data).
Analyze: You need to see if you already know the concepts or do you need to revisit it. You need to
see the articles from different sites according to your understanding. For example, you may not
understand some concept from one site so you switch to another for the same concept or what you
can do is to check the rating of sites on Google beforehand.
Share: Now you check with your friends about the important topics and also discuss what sites they
are referring to and what chapters they are preferring to study first.
Act: Now, when everything is settled, your schedule, timetable, to-do list, study material, now itâ€™s
time to act. So, now you start studying.
