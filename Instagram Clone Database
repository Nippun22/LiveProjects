--Project Description
--This project deals with Instagram user’s data. Using SQL, the project will fetch actionable
--insights for the product and marketing teams and investors.
--Approach
--A.
--1. Loyal user reward
SELECT id, username, created_at FROM users ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 5;
--2. Interactive user engagement
SELECT user.id, user.username FROM users LEFT JOIN photos ON user.id =
photos.user_id WHERE photos.id IS NULL;
--3. Contest winner declaration
SELECT u.id, u.username, p.id AS photo_id, COUNT(l.photo_id) AS total_likes
FROM users u JOIN photos p ON u.id = p.user_id LEFT JOIN likes l ON p.id =
l.photo_id group by p.id order by total_likes desc limit 1;
--4. Hashtag Research
SELECT t.tag_name, COUNT(pt.tag_id) AS tag_count FROM tags t JOIN
photo_tags pt ON t.id = pt.tag_id group by t.tag_name order by tag_count
desc limit 5;
--5. Ad campaign launch
SELECT DAYNAME(created_at) AS reg_day, COUNT(*) AS reg_count FROM users
group by reg_day order by reg_count desc limit 1;

--B.
--1. User engagement
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photos) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) AS
avg_posts_per_user;

--2. Bots & fake accounts

SELECT u.id, u.username FROM users u JOIN likes l ON u.id = l.user_id group by
u.id, u.username having COUNT(DISTINCT l.photo_id) = (SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM photos);

--Teck-Stack used: MySQL Workbench

--Insights:
--Using registration timestamps, the five oldest users can be identified and then tagged as
--loyal users. The people having account and still not posted anything can be categorised as
--“inactive users”. We can send them promotional emails to encourage them to post content
--and be active on the social media. The user having the most likes on a particular post or
--photo is chosen as contest winner. Top five hashtags have been found that can help brands
--to reach more and more people by using these hashtags on their posts or reels. Most of the
--users have registered on Thursday which makes it a lucky day for optimal Ad timing. The
--average number of posts per user is 1.3. A bot is the one that shows unusual behaviour like
--one user liked every post in the database which means it's a bot.

--Results:
--All the tasks done using SQL queries effectively showing great results.
